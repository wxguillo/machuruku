\title{Account for uncertainty in divergence time estimation from a posterior distribution of trees}
\usage{
machu.trees.unc(file, burnin = 0.1, conf = 0.95, inc = 10000, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{input file, provided as a filepath string. File must be NEXUS format with multiple
trees and a translation table of taxon names (e.g., 1 Homo sapiens). Only tested with BEAST 2 output.}

\item{burnin}{a numeric value between 0 and 1, denoting the percentage of trees to skip. MCMC chains do
not usually converge right away, so it is common practice to skip the first 10\% or so of samples as "burn-in".
The default value is 10\%.}

\item{conf}{a numeric value between 0 and 1, denoting the desired tree-height HPD interval to sample trees from. Values
closer to 1 will result in more extreme trees. The default value is 95\%.}

\item{inc}{the increment value at which the function will shout its progress at you, if verbose=TRUE. Default
is 10,000.}

\item{verbose}{shout progress, turned on by default}
}
\value{
returns a list of three phylo objects characterizing the uncertainty in divergence time of the posterior
distribution of trees and enabling the user to use the trees as separate inputs for Machuruku.

\description{
This function creates a list of three trees that characterize the uncertainty in divergence
times from a Bayesian posterior distribution of trees. It is written to work with a NEXUS file
containing multiple trees and a translation table of taxon names, specifically the output of
BEAST 2 but the format is generic enough to likely work with other program outputs as well.
The function is written to use a file without loading it into R and overloading memory, as
posterior treefiles can be very large in size.
The function conducts three passes through the posterior:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates the overall number of trees and the amount skipped as burn-in
\item Calculates the distribution of tree-heights and attendant 95\% HPD interval
\item Finds the trees with tree-heights closest to the upper 95\% HPD, lower 95\% HPD, and average
The output of the function is a list of three phylo objects, each of which can be separately
used as tree input for Machuruku.
