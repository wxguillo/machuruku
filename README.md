## August 1 2023: Development page for Machuruku version 2.0
I am in the process of updating the Machuruku code and tutorial to version 2.0, which will come with enhancements to speed and functionality across the board as a ground-up rewrite of the entire package. Please be patient as I get everything up and running over the next few days before merging this branch with main.
