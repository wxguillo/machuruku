# Machuruku: the Tutorial
Welcome! On this page I'll be walking you through using the R package I developed with [Jason Brown](https://www.jasonleebrown.org/), Machuruku. Machuruku is developed for modeling, reconstructing, and visualizing niches in past and present climates, while accounting for evolution. It is a spiritual successor to [previous](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00461.x) [implementations](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/595757) of [phylogenetic](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/55/5/785/1666006) [niche](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2148-6-72) [modeling](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/59/3/322/1703086). However, our derivation of the methods and ideas in Machuruku was independent of these earlier studies. The main idea of Machuruku is to construct niches for every taxon in a time-calibrated phylogeny, reconstruct ancestral niches at each node, and project ancestral niches into current- or paleoclimatic data to create real-world estimates of the geographic origins of lineages. 

First, I will provide a very quick guide to using Machuruku on a basic level. Then, I will do a deeper dive into the various functions provided and how they can assist you in accounting for uncertainty, performing better visualizations, and other tasks.

## Introduction
### Installing Machuruku
To install Machuruku, simply use the `install_github()` function from `devtools`:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wxguillo/machuruku")
```
Load up Machuruku by running:
```
library(machuruku)
```
You can test if it worked by typing `machu` into the console (in RStudio) and seeing if all of the functions appear in autofill.
### Downloading and exploring tutorial data
First off, go ahead and download the tutorial data I've provided in this repository. This consists of three files: 
* `basslerigroup.treefile` - A nexus-formatted treefile containing the three members of the *Ameerega bassleri* group, a small clade of Amazonian dendrobatid poison frogs. This tree was time-calibrated in [BEAST 2](https://www.beast2.org/) and contains 95% HPD intervals for each node height (divergence time). It is a small subset of the UCE phylogeny of *Ameerega* presented in [Guillory et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319304609), restricted to the *bassleri* group ([*Ameerega bassleri*](https://www.dendrobates.org/dendrobatoidea/dendrobatidae/colostethinae/ameerega/ameerega-bassleri/), [*pepperi*](https://www.dendrobates.org/dendrobatoidea/dendrobatidae/colostethinae/ameerega/ameerega-pepperi/), and [*yoshina*](https://www.dendrobates.org/dendrobatoidea/dendrobatidae/colostethinae/ameerega/ameerega-yoshina/)) plus [*A. silverstonei*](https://www.dendrobates.org/dendrobatoidea/dendrobatidae/colostethinae/ameerega/ameerega-silverstonei/), an in-genus outgroup taxon with a similar distribution.
* `basslerigroup.csv` - Occurrence data for each species in our phylogeny, in decimal-degree format. The first column is the species ID (which must match that in the tree), the second is longitude (x), and the third is latitude (y). This format must be adhered to when using occurrence data in Machuruku.
* `climate.zip` - A zipped file containing the climate data we will be using. If you unzip the file, you will get a folder called `climate/`, which in turn contains four subfolders: `current/`, `mis19/`, `mpwp/`, and `m2/`. These four subfolders correspond to a different time period (modern-day, Marine Isotope Stage 19 (Pleistocene; 0.787 Ma), Mid-Pliocene Warming Period (3.205 Ma), and Marine Isotope Stage M2 (Pliocene; 3.3 Ma). Inside each subfolder are two raster climate layers, formatted as tiffs: `bio_1.tif` and `bio_12.tif`. The tiffs represent climate data analogous to the bioclimatic layers from [Worldclim](https://www.worldclim.org/); each one is an aspect of climate that is believed to be important to organisms biologically, and are thus commonly used in ecological niche modeling. For space (and simplicity) reasons, I have restricted our dataset to just Bio1 (Mean Annual Temperature) and Bio12 (Annual Precipitation). Also, these two variables are highly uncorrelated, which is beneficial for our analyses anyway. The actual layers provided in `climate.zip` are taken from [PaleoClim](http://www.paleoclim.org/), a free set of paleoclimatic data from various time periods up to the Late Pliocene, formatted specifically for ease of use in niche modeling. Their extent is trimmed to an area surrounding the distributions of these four frogs. 

To get started, go ahead and place these three files in a folder anywhere on your machine; I suggest simply calling it `tutorial/`. Unzip `climate.zip` inside of `tutorial/` to get the `climate/` folder.

Load up R and set your working directory to `tutorial/`. Use the `setwd()` function:
```
setwd("~/YOUR/DIRECTORY/STRUCTURE/tutorial")
```
#### Loading tree
There are a few ways to load trees into R. The most common is the `read.nexus()` function from the `ape` package. 
```
# install.packages("ape")
# library(ape) 
# you may have to install and load ape separately
bassleritree <- read.nexus("basslerigroup.treefile")
```
For future purposes we might use another function, because this particular R object type doesn't store node height uncertainty information.

You can simply use the `plot()` function to visualize the tree:
```
plot(bassleritree)
```
![plot() tree](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/plot%20tree.png?raw=true)

As you can see, this shows you the relationships between the taxa and the relative branch lengths, but gives you no information as to the actual divergence times. Later we'll use functions designed to visualize these and other aspects of the tree to make it easier to tell what you're actually doing.
#### Loading occurrence data
Loading occurrence data is simple. Use the `read.csv()` or `read.delim()` function:
```
occ	<- read.delim("basslerigroup.csv", h=T, sep=",")
```
We can visualize the occurrence data in a minute, after we've loaded the climate data as well.
#### Loading climate data
The `raster()` function is necessary to load climate rasters into R. Go ahead and brute-force this, loading each raster individually:
```
# install.packages("raster")
# library(raster)
# you may have to install and load the 'raster' package separately
# current climate data
bio1 <- raster("climate/current/bio_1.tif")
bio12 <- raster("climate/current/bio_12.tif")

# early pleistocene data
bio1mis19 <- raster("climate/mis19/bio_1.tif")
bio12mis19 <- raster("climate/mis19/bio_12.tif")

# mid pliocene warm period
bio1mpwp <- raster("climate/mpwp/bio_1.tif")
bio12mpwp <- raster("climate/mpwp/bio_12.tif")

# pliocene data
bio1m2 <- raster("climate/m2/bio_1.tif")
bio12m2 <- raster("climate/m2/bio_12.tif")
```
Then use `stack()` to *stack* layers from the same time period into a RasterStack object:
```
ClimCur <- stack(bio1, bio12)
ClimMis19 <- stack(bio1mis19, bio12mis19)
ClimMpwp <- stack(bio1mpwp, bio12mpwp)
ClimM2 <- stack(bio1m2, bio12m2)
```
Run the following code block to plot the current-climate Bio1 raster, then show the occurrence data, coloring each species separately, and finally print a legend so we can tell what species the points correspond to.
```
# visualize raster layer
plot(bio1)

# visualize occurrence data w/ legend
taxa <- c(as.character(unique(occ$species)))
for (i in taxa){
  points(subset(occ, species==i)$long_DD, subset(occ, species==i)$lat_DD, col = which(taxa==i)+3, pch=16, cex=0.75)
}
legend("topright", legend = c(as.character(unique(occ$species))), col = 4:8, pch=16)
```
![bio1 w/ points](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/bio1%20w%20pts.png?raw=true)

Now we can see that the species' ranges do not really overlap, but are very close to each other. They evolved in a place with lots of topographic heterogeneity (the foothills of the Andes), which according to our theory promoted their diversification. We might be able to see some niche evolution in this group, since they occupy subtly different habitats.
## Quick-start Guide
Machuruku is composed of three principal steps that can be completed quickly. In this section I'll demonstrate these three steps without extraneous bells-and-whistles in case you don't feel like doing a deeper dive or are simply pressed for time. Let's set a phylogenetic niche modeling goal for ourselves: To see what the ancestors of the *bassleri* group and *A. silverstonei* were doing in the Late Pliocene, approximately 3.3 million years ago (the putative age of our M2 climate layers). What's important to note here is that it's highly unlikely that any of our nodes will exactly line up with the age of our paleoclimate data, e.g., none of the nodes will be 3.3 million years old. To accommodate this fact of life, Machuruku can interpolate ancestral niches along the branches subtending the desired time-slice. This can be kind of tricky to visualize, so Machuruku has a built-in function, `machu.treeplot()`, that can do it for us.
```
machu.treeplot(bassleritree, upperX = 2, timelabeloffset = 1, timeslice = 3.3)
```
![treeplot 3.3](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/treeplot.png?raw=true)

The time-slice at 3.3 Ma recovers *two* taxa, not the four at the tips, so we'll be making two ancestral niche models.
### Estimating tip response curves
The first step in Machuruku is embedded in the `machu.1.tip.resp()` function (The principal functions of Machuruku are numbered to make it easy to remember what order to do them in). This step takes your occurrence data and your present-day climate data, constructs a Bioclim niche model for each taxon, and then characterizes the response of each taxon to each climate variable as a skew-normal distribution. 
```
resp <- machu.1.tip.resp(occ, ClimCur, verbose = T)
```
Since `verbose = T`, R will print progress to the screen. It should finish very quickly. 
### Estimating ancestral niches at a time-slice
The second step is using `machu.2.ace()` to estimate ancestral niches at our desired time-slice. This step takes your response table as input, along with information regarding your time-slice, among other desired parameters, and uses the `ace()` function from [`ape`](http://ape-package.ird.fr/) to estimate the niche parameters at each node, using a continuous-character implementation of ancestral character estimation, with Brownian motion as our evolutionary model. Since we specified a time-slice, the function will interpolate the models along whatever subtending branches are present at that time, and present those as the output.
```
ace <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, T=3.3)
```
This should finish almost immediately.
> If you want to get ancestral niche models for each *node,* not interpolated along a branch, you can run `machu.2.ace()` without specifying a time-slice. I'll get into this more in my more detailed tutorial below.
### Projecting ancestral models into paleoclimatic data
The final major step is to use `machu.3.anc.niche()` to project the ancestral niche models estimated and parsed as `ace` into our M2 paleoclimate data. This step loops through each taxon in `ace` and constructs a Bioclim model in the provided paleoclimate data.
```
mod <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace, ClimM2, verbose = T)
```
Since `verbose = T`, R will print your progress to the screen. This process is usually the most time-consuming, but it should still take only a few seconds given our low taxon and climate variable count. The next thing to do is visualize these models, which we can do with a final function, `machu.plotmap()`.
```
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
machu.plotmap(mod)
```
![2 maps](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/2%20mods.png?raw=true)

There we go! We can see immediately that the ancestor of the *bassleri* group was probably more widespread. The more northern regions of suitable climate were probably unoccupied due to geographical constraints, but not climatological ones. 
## Detailed guide
In this section I'll take you through the process step-by-step again, but with much more detail so that you know what each option does, and also go into the various accessory functions that can aid visualization and account for various sources of bias and uncertainty (if you're paranoid). 
### Estimating tip response curves
This step takes your occurrence data and your present-day climate data, constructs a Bioclim niche model for each taxon, and then characterizes the response of each taxon to each climate variable as a skew-normal distribution. The distribution is parsed into five components (mean, standard deviation, skew, upper 95% confidence interval, and lower 95% confidence interval); the last two components are only used for a few accessory functions, so you can mostly ignore those. 
```
resp <- machu.1.tip.resp(occ, ClimCur, verbose = T)
```
> The function will automatically assume that, in your `occ` object, the sample IDs are in column 1, the longitudes (x-coords) are in column 2, and the latitudes (y-coords) are in column 3. If your `occ` is formatted differently, you can either rearrange it or just specify which column is which with the `sp.col`, `long.col`, and `lat.col` arguments.

Since `verbose = T`, R will print progress to the screen. It should finish very quickly. This is more useful when you have a lot of taxa or climate variables and you want a general idea of how long it takes to process each one. Printing `resp` to the screen will show this:
```
             bio_1_mean bio_1_stdev bio_1_skew bio_1_lowerQ bio_1_upperQ bio_12_mean bio_12_stdev bio_12_skew bio_12_lowerQ bio_12_upperQ
bassleri       232.3243   16.700057  1.0000000      204.400      255.100    1380.014     289.9077   2.2902138        973.80      2058.400
pepperi        245.1000   11.059938  1.0000000      226.450      258.325    1759.836     299.0108   0.8788606       1312.65      2251.700
silverstonei   189.4364    6.815318  0.8878531      177.400      199.000    4569.632     634.5430   0.6909963       3443.60      5477.400
yoshina        242.0000   14.929464  1.0000000      211.375      252.000    1616.009     250.0849 299.9526457       1285.00      2104.475
```
This is basically a bunch of named vectors glommed together. Each row corresponds to a taxon, and each column to a climate response parameter. Every set of five columns (mean, stdev, skew, lowerQ, and upperQ) corresponds to a different climate variable. Since we only have two climate variables (Bio1 and Bio12) and four taxa, our response table is pretty small.
#### Accounting for spatial autocorrelation by rarefying occurrence data
A classic issue in niche modeling (and other practices that utilize occurrence data) is that occurrence data is almost always spatially biased in some way, usually due to our imperfect human natures. When we go collecting organismal specimens out in the field, we tend to hover around roads, field stations, and cities. Why? Because it's easier that way. However, this has the unfortunate side-effect of biasing our spatial data around these locations - a phenomenon called spatial autocorrelation. This will in turn bias the niche modeling algorithm, because it'll assume that since you have more points in these areas, the species in question must like something about them more. For this reason, it can be important to "rarefy" your spatial data, essentially removing points that are clustered by a certain distance, so that you have a more even spread of points. In Machuruku, we have provided a function, `machu.occ.rarefy()` that does this for you (this function is identical to one included in the R package [`humboldt`](https://github.com/jasonleebrown/humboldt), also by Jason Brown).
```
occ.rarefied <- machu.occ.rarefy(in.pts = occ, rarefy.dist = 10)
```
The function will tell you that we have gone from 67 to 29 points after rarefication. If you look at `occ.rarefied`, you'll see that we now have 14 *bassleri* points, 6 each for *pepperi* and *yoshina*, and only 3 for *silverstonei*! However, this isn't as big of a problem as you might think.
> The niche modeling algorithm we use will work with any number of points as long as it is greater than 1. Of course, more points are always better, as long as they aren't spatially biased. 

The `rarefy.dist` argument will need to be adjusted depending on your dataset; our points are all very constrained geographically so we use a fairly low value, and still have over a 50% reduction in points. Larger values for `rarefy.dist` will retain fewer points.

Let's plot our map of Peru again, with the pre-rarefication points in black, and the rarefied points layered on top in color, so we can see exactly what was removed:
```
# plot rarefied points
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(bio1, axes = F, xlim = c(-78, -74), ylim = c(-10,-5))
points(occ$long_DD, occ$lat_DD, pch = 16, cex = 0.75)
taxa <- c(as.character(unique(occ.rarefied$species)))
for (i in taxa){
  points(subset(occ.rarefied, species==i)$long_DD, subset(occ.rarefied, species==i)$lat_DD, col = which(taxa==i)+3, pch=16, cex=0.75)
}
legend("topright", legend = c(as.character(unique(occ$species))), col = 4:8, pch=16)
```
![rarefied points](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/bio%201%20rare.png?raw=true)

I used the `xlim` and `ylim` parameters in `plot()` to zoom in so that you can see the points more clearly. All of the visible black points were removed; we can see that they are all clustered very tightly around the colored points - probably because the people that collected those data (read: us) were spending all day at a single site, instead of spreading their effort equally throughout the frogs' distributions.

Let's use our new `occ.rarefied` dataset to re-run our `machu.1.tip.resp()` analysis. 
```
resp <- machu.1.tip.resp(occ.rarefied, ClimCur, verbose = T)
```
If you look at `resp`, you'll notice that the climate response values are somewhat different than before, because we made niche models using different occurrence data. These models should be less biased due to spatial autocorrelation.
#### Visualizing climate response curves
If you're interested in visualizing these nebulous "climate response curves", there's a function for that, too. `machu.respplot()` is a flexible function that can show you how each taxon responds to individual climate variables in a variety of ways.
```
machu.respplot(resp)
```
![response curves](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/resp%20curves.png?raw=true)

If you don't specify any taxa, climate variables, or other parameters, `machu.respplot()` will just plot all of them. (Note that if you have lots of taxa or climate variables, it may not work!) This works for combinations, too, so you can plot all taxa for one climate variable, or all climate variables for one taxon. There are also aesthetic parameters to change the way the lines look. For instance, if we want to just see how *A. bassleri* responds to the two climate variables, we can specify:
```
machu.respplot(resp, taxa = "bassleri", linewidth = 2, linecolor = "coral3")
```
![bassleri response curves](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/bassleri%20resp.png?raw=true)

You can also use the index of your taxa to specify them in particular combinations, if you don't feel like typing out their names:
```
machu.respplot(resp, taxa = c(1,4), clim = "bio_1", linewidth = 2, linecolor = "coral3")
```
![bassleri & yoshina curves](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/bassleri%20and%20yoshina%20curves.png?raw=true)

We can see that *yoshina* has a *much* more skewed response to Bio1 than *bassleri* here. However, it can be kind of difficult to directly compare the response curves between two species this way, since they're plotted on different axes and in different panels. That's where the `comb` argument comes in:
```
machu.respplot(resp, taxa = c(1,4), clim = "bio_1", linewidth = 2, comb = T)
```
![bio1 combined](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/bio1%20comb.png?raw=true)

Using `comb = TRUE` allows us to compare response curves for each species directly. Below, we can look at all species and all climate variables at once:
```
machu.respplot(resp, linewidth = 2, comb = T, legend.pos = "topright")
```
![all variables combined](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/all%20vars%20comb.png?raw=true)

Right away, we can see some differences between the *bassleri* group and *A. silverstonei.* You can tell that these two lineages evolved in different climatic regimes; *silverstonei* tends to inhabit cooler climates (it's lower in Bio1) and rainier ones (it's higher in Bio12). The three members of the *bassleri* group are more clustered, which makes sense since they're much more closely related—but they've each evolved subtly different niches.

`machu.respplot` also works with the output of `machu.2.ace()`, if you want to see how extant species compare to their ancestors in this way. Visualizing lineages along with their ancestors and relatives can lead to some pretty cool insights.
### Estimating ancestral niches
The second step is using `machu.2.ace()` to estimate ancestral niches at our desired time-slice. This step takes your response table as input, along with information regarding your time-slice, among other desired parameters, and uses the `ace()` function from [`ape`](http://ape-package.ird.fr/) to estimate the niche parameters at each node, using a continuous-character implementation of ancestral character estimation, with Brownian motion as our evolutionary model. You can choose to specify a time-slice, in which case the function will interpolate the models along the branches subtending that time-slice, or you can choose to simply return a model for each node.
#### Estimating niches at a time-slice
If you skipped the quick-start guide, you may be wondering what I mean by a "time-slice". Imagine a phylogeny lined up on a timescale; cut a slice through it perpendicular to that scale, and count how many branches the slice cuts through, and note which nodes or tips lie on either end of these branches. Time-slicing may be necessary because, while a phylogeny is a continuous-time construct, your paleoclimate data is dated to a particular point-estimate of time, e.g. your phylogeny may span 0-5 Ma, while your paleoclimate data is dated at 3 Ma. This inconsistency can make it difficult to tell what exactly to project into that paleoclimate data, since it's unlikely any of your phylogeny's nodes will be at exactly 3 Ma. If you take a time-slice through the phylogeny at 3 Ma, this problem is solved. To visualize time-slices through our tutorial tree, each corresponding to the age of our four climate datasets, run the following:
```
machu.treeplot(bassleritree, upperX = 2, timelabeloffset = 1, timeslice = c(0,0.787,3.205,3.3))
```
![tree w time slices](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/time%20slices.png?raw=true)

The current-climate, furthest to the right, simply cuts through the tips; Mis19, 0.787 Ma old (Pleistocene), recovers each of the four immediate ancestors of the extant taxa (perhaps effectively the same (chrono)species); Mpwp, second from the left (3.205 Ma), and M2, first on the left (3.3 Ma), both Late Pliocene, are very close together, but this was a period of intense climatic change so the two datasets are actually quite different. The two Pliocene time-slices recover two ancestral lineages (the ancestor of the *bassleri* group and the immediate ancestor of *A. silverstonei*). The former "taxon" would be called "Node5-Node6", and the latter "Node5-silverstonei". 
> The `upperX` and `timelabeloffset` arguments in `machu.treeplot()` are just there to fit the tree to the window, so YMMV with these parameters. This is just due to how [`ggtree`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html), the package the function uses to visualize the tree, works. There are also aesthetic parameters to change the colors and line-type of the time-slice, but really I recommend exporting the image (as PDF) and editing it in a vector editor like Illustrator or Inkscape if you want to use it in a publication.

To run `machu.2.ace()` with a time-slice, simply call it using the `T` argument:
```
# run one time-slice for each time period
ace.mis19 <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, T=0.787)
ace.mpwp <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, T=3.205)
ace.M2 <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, T = 3.3)
```
>Note that here I've done one run for each of the three paleoclimatic datasets. I've also used the version of `resp` that was derived from rarefied occurrence data, so you won't get the same results if you aren't using that one.

Let's confirm that our output contains the ancestral taxa that we'd expect. Remember that Mis19 corresponds to the third time-slice pictured above, so we'd expect four ancestral taxa. The `ace.mis19` output looks like this:
```
$bio_1_mean
                name branch_start branch_end    value
1     Node7-bassleri            7          1 229.7862
2      Node7-yoshina            7          4 233.7089
3      Node6-pepperi            6          2 240.4937
4 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 192.6381

$bio_1_stdev
                name branch_start branch_end    value
1     Node7-bassleri            7          1 16.15572
2      Node7-yoshina            7          4 13.93988
3      Node6-pepperi            6          2 14.06111
4 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 13.88672
...
```
(I've only shown the first two elements of the list, to save space.) We can see that the output is formatted as a list, where each element corresponds to one of the climatic response parameters (e.g., a column from the output of `machu.1.tip.resp()`). Each element is a table, where the value for that parameter is shown for each taxon. Each row corresponds to a taxon; we see right away that each table has four rows, so Machuruku got the right number of taxa at this time period. 
> Also shown are the nodes/tips that lie on either side of (subtend) the branch that that taxon represents (`branch_start` is the older one and `branch_end` is the newer one). The numbers refer to node and tip IDs that are encoded into the tree when it is imported by the `read.nexus()` function. The tips are given IDs first, as 1-through-4 (or however many taxa you have). The nodes are then added; in this case, there are 3 nodes, so the nodes are given IDs 5-through-7. Referring to these numbers in conjunction with a tree visualization from `machu.treeplot()` can help you get your bearings in the tree.

Let's check one of the Pliocene outputs, because for these (the first two time-slices in the figure above), we'd expect two taxa each.
```
$bio_1_mean
                name branch_start branch_end    value
1        Node5-Node6            5          6 232.5243
2 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 197.6712

$bio_1_stdev
                name branch_start branch_end    value
1        Node5-Node6            5          6 14.62475
2 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 13.97985
...
```
These are the first two elements of `ace.mpwp`. We can see that there are now two taxa retained, one along the branch leading from node 5 to node 6 (the ancestor of the *bassleri* group), and one leading from node 5 to *A. silverstonei.*
#### Estimating niches for all nodes
Let's say you're not interested in a particular time-slice, but you want to compare the niches at each node in a phylogeny with the niches of the tips (descendant taxa) in the same climate-space. This can be easily accomplished simply by running `machu.2.ace` without specifying a time-slice.
```
ace.all <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree)
```
The output of this, `ace.all`, will provide us with niche models for the nodes, as well as retaining those of the tips (to make it easy to compare them later):
```
$bio_1_mean
          name      time NA    value
1     bassleri  0.000000 NA 228.1429
2      pepperi  0.000000 NA 243.3333
3 silverstonei  0.000000 NA 191.0000
4      yoshina  0.000000 NA 234.1507
5        Node5 11.577178 NA 215.0977
6        Node6  2.710415 NA 233.5538
7        Node7  2.267554 NA 232.8777

$bio_1_stdev
          name      time NA    value
1     bassleri  0.000000 NA 16.87901
2      pepperi  0.000000 NA 13.82269
3 silverstonei  0.000000 NA 13.85641
4      yoshina  0.000000 NA 13.48532
5        Node5 11.577178 NA 14.30230
6        Node6  2.710415 NA 14.64380
7        Node7  2.267554 NA 14.79502
...
```
These are the first two elements of `ace.all`. There are seven taxa, the first four of which are the extant taxa (bearing no difference from their values in `resp`), and the last three are each of the nodes; Node5 is the root node, Node6 is the immediate common ancestor of the *bassleri* group, and Node7 is the common ancestor of *A. bassleri* and *A. yoshina*. 
> Rather than tell you about branch starts and ends, this output shows you the age of each taxon. The third `NA` column is a placeholder (four columns are required in this output).

We can visualize how these taxa have evolved in climate space with respect to each climate variable by using `machu.respplot()`:
```
machu.respplot(ace.all, comb = T, legend.pos = "topright")
```
![visualization of ancestors](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/ancestor%20vis.png?raw=true)

There's a lot to see in this plot, partially occluded by the legend. But right away we can see how Node5, the putative common ancestor of the *bassleri* group and *A. silverstonei*, occupied an intermediate climate space between these two descendants. (Of course, including all ~32 *Ameerega* species in our analyses would change these results quite a bit!)
#### Accounting for uncertainty in ancestral character estimation
As any good phylogeneticist will tell you (and a bunch of classic papers), using ancestral character estimation (=ancestral state reconstruction) can be fraught because of the uncertainty inherent in this technique, and our assumptions that evolution is essentially happening randomly (Brownian motion). Absent any other information, these seem like fine null assumptions, so there is not much we can do. But if you wish, Machuruku can take some of the uncertainty inherent in ancestral character estimation into account when constructing niche models in the final step. This is actually a recommended approach for our program, as it'll lead to less stringent and more interpretable models. You can activate this feature by using the `n.unc` argument and specifying a number:
```
ace.M2.unc <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, T = 3.3, n.unc = 4)
```
Note that here we're taking a time-slice corresponding for our M2 paleoclimate data. What the `n.unc = 4` specification does is take `n.unc` evenly-spaced samples of the 95% confidence intervals surrounding the median reconstructed value. If you look at `ace.M2.unc`, you can see that there are a bunch of new columns, each corresponding to one of these samples:
```
$bio_1_mean
                name branch_start branch_end    value     unc1     unc2     unc3     unc4
1        Node5-Node6            5          6 232.3266 220.9530 228.5354 236.1177 243.7001
2 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 197.8689 190.8343 195.5240 200.2138 204.9035

$bio_1_stdev
                name branch_start branch_end    value     unc1     unc2     unc3     unc4
1        Node5-Node6            5          6 14.62110 12.92806 14.05675 15.18544 16.31413
2 Node5-silverstonei            5          3 13.98351 12.93633 13.63445 14.33256 15.03068
...
```
There is still the `value` column, with the median value, and after that, four (`n.unc`) columns of samples from the 95% confidence interval distribution. The first of these columns (`unc1`) is essentially the lower 95% confidence limit, and the last (`unc4`) is the upper limit. `unc2` and `unc4` will be evenly spaced between the limits. Imagine that each of these columns represents an independent niche model, at a certain part of the distribution of possible models. Basically, in step 3, you'd be constructing 4 (in this case) independent niche models, then summing and rescaling them. This accounts for uncertainty much better than simply using the median.
#### Accounting for uncertainty in divergence time estimation given one tree with error bars
Another source of uncertainty in Machuruku comes from our time-calibrated tree itself. In a phylogeny, there are going to be two main areas where uncertainty occurs: the topology, and the branch lengths. We can't do a lot about the topology here - if you aren't certain about the topology of your tree, just run Machuruku on two or more trees with slightly different topologies. For uncertainty in branch lengths, which for a time-calibrated tree corresponds to divergence times, we can do something, though.

Many (if not all) programs used for divergence time estimation will provide each node with error bars that usually describe the 95% probability distribution of ages for that node. Our *bassleri* group tree was calibrated using [BEAST 2](https://www.beast2.org/), a popular Bayesian phylogenetics program. It comes with error bars called 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) intervals. (Maximum likelihood programs like RelTime will give you 95% confidence intervals.) However, when we load our tree with the `read.nexus()` function from `ape`, we lose that error bar information when the tree is converted to a Phylo object. So, we need to use another function: `read.beast()` from the [`treeio`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/treeio.html) package.
```
# install.packages("treeio")
# library(treeio)
# you may have to install and load treeio separately
# load tree as treedata object
bassleribeast <- read.beast("basslerigroup.treefile")
```
The tree is now stored as a Treedata object, which contains all of the information regarding node heights (and more) from the original file. 
> To extract this information for your own purposes, use the construct `bassleribeast@data$height` (for example) or convert the tree to a "Tibble" object using the `as_tibble()` function.

> Currently I have only ensured that `machu.tree.unc()` only works with output from BEAST 2. Because of the way RelTime stores its node height data, it will not work with this function absent some significant changes.

Now let's run the `machu.tree.unc()` function, which will take our tree and produce two additional trees using the 95% HPD intervals at each node: one tree where the node heights correspond to the upper 95% HPD limit, and another where they correspond to the lower. Then, let's use `machu.treeplot()` to visualize all three trees at once:
```
trees <- machu.tree.unc(bassleribeast)
machu.treeplot(trees, upperX = 3, timelabeloffset = 1.25, nodecirclecolor = "darkseagreen2")
```
![3 trees](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/3trees.png?raw=true)

Three trees have been plotted on the same time scale. The top tree is our "lower confidence interval" (LCI) tree, the middle tree is our median starting tree, and the bottom tree is our "upper confidence interval" (UCI) tree. The node heights of the LCI and UCI trees have been pushed backwards or forwards to match the corresponding confidence limits of the median tree. The three trees are stored together in a list (for us, called `trees`) that contains them as its elements: `LCI tree`, `input tree`, and `UCI tree`.

So what's the point of this? We can use a single time-slice to illustrate why `machu.tree.unc()` might be useful.
```
machu.treeplot(trees, upperX = 3, timelabeloffset = 1.25, nodecirclecolor = "darkseagreen2", timeslice = 2.49)
```
![3 trees w/ time-slice](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/3trees%20w%20timeslice.png?raw=true)

If you are time-slicing the phylogeny in a certain place, you may recover different branch-taxa depending on the heights of the nodes. In the LCI tree (top), we are getting two taxa: Node5-Node6 and Node5-silverstonei. In the median input tree, we are getting three: Node6-Node7, Node6-pepperi, and Node5-silverstonei. And in the UCI tree (bottom), we get four: Node7-yoshina, Node7-bassleri, Node6-pepperi, and Node5-silverstonei. These will dramatically change your ancestral niche modeling results, because you're literally making niche models for a different number of taxa. The idea is to construct these additional trees, and then run Machuruku for them three separate times, and compare the results. That would look something like this:
```
ace.LCI <- machu.2.ace(resp, as.phylo(trees$`LCI tree`), T = 2.49)
ace.input <- machu.2.ace(resp, as.phylo(trees$`input tree`), T = 2.49)
ace.UCI <- machu.2.ace(resp, as.phylo(trees$`UCI tree`), T = 2.49)
```
Note that we need to use the `as.phylo` function to convert the treedata objects stored in the `trees` list to get them to work properly. If you look at each of the three objects we made, you'll see that `ace.LCI` has two taxa, `ace.input` has three, and `ace.UCI` has four - just as we predicted.
> You may be wondering why we characterize divergence time uncertainty this way and not by utilizing the whole posterior distribution of trees, or a "tree cloud", where nearly every possible tree within the 95% HPD intervals is represented. The short answer is that this is perhaps a good idea, but we don't think it particularly useful because of our emphasis on visualization. We can't really think of a way to visualize a "cloud" of reconstructed niches that is easy to interpret, especially since for a particular time-slice you'd have all manner of taxa present in different trees.

#### Accounting for uncertainty in divergence time estimation given a Bayesian posterior distribution of trees
Very astute readers may notice that the above method for accounting for divergence time uncertainty isn't perfect, because the two additional trees constructed by the `machu.tree.unc` function are *chimeric,* meaning their node-height information comes from multiple trees that were ultimately summarized by TreeAnnotator when we turned the Bayesian posterior distribution of trees into a single summary tree (that we then imported into R with `read.beast`). Because of this, the additional trees are not ultrametric, e.g. the different paths from root to tip are not the same length (though they are close); we solve this problem using the `force.ultrametric` function from [`phytools`](http://blog.phytools.org/). 

If this bugs you, there is yet another function for accounting for uncertainty in divergence time estimation: `machu.trees.unc`. It's called *trees* as opposed to *tree* because this time the input is an entire posterior distribution of trees, as is commonly output from most Bayesian phylogenetics programs (for this reason, `machu.trees.unc` should work with output from programs other than BEAST, as well). Because these posterior distributions can contain thousands or even millions of trees, using them in R can be next to impossible. For this reason, `machu.trees.unc` works *without* loading the trees into R; you just call the file location instead:
```
trees <- machu.trees.unc("posterior.trees")
```
Similarly to `machu.tree.unc`, this function will output a list of three trees, only this time the trees are actually sampled directly from the posterior, contained in the example file `posterior.trees`. This file is called simply as a text string and contains a very small "posterior distribution" of 19 trees from our [Guillory et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790319304609) *Ameerega* paper, with 35 taxa in each tree (1 per *Ameerega* species). Using `machu.treeplot` again, we can visualize the trees like so:
```
machu.treeplot(trees, upperX = 7, tiplabelsize = 2.5,
               timelabeloffset = 1.01, timelabelsize = 2,
               nodecirclecolor = "darkseagreen2", nodecirclesize = 5, nodelabelsize = 3)
```
![3 trees from machu.trees.unc](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/machu%20trees.png?raw=true)

The function works by loading each tree in the file one at a time in a series of three passes. The first pass simply counts how many trees are present, and then calculates the number to be skipped at a desired burn-in level (by default this is set to 10%, rounded up; in our case, with 19 trees, the first 2 trees were skipped). 
> Burn-in refers to the phenomenon where generally a chain of posterior samples takes a while to stabilize around a certain value, so when summarizing the posterior (as in the program TreeAnnotator, etc.), the first X% of samples are generally ignored. In `machu.trees.unc`, the exact burn-in percentage ignored can be specified with the `burnin` parameter, by default set to 0.1 (=10%).

The second pass then calculates the distribution of tree-heights in the posterior (i.e., it calculates tree-height for every tree), and then calculates the 95% HPD interval and mean of this tree-height distribution. The third and final pass identifies those trees with tree-heights closest to the upper and lower 95% HPD limits and average, and puts them into the output list (`trees` in our case).
> Much like the burn-in percentage, the HPD confidence limit percentage can also be manipulated using the `conf` parameter, which is by default set to 0.95 (=95%). To identify the most extreme trees (min and max heights), you would simply set `conf = 1`. However, these are likely to be total outliers and not very useful for your project.

#### Saving and loading ace output
We also provide a function that allows you to save your `machu.2.ace()` output to an external file and reload it for later. If you use the `savename` parameter in the `machu.2.ace()` function:
```
# save machu.2.ace() output
ace.all <- machu.2.ace(resp, bassleritree, savename = "ace_all")
```
Machuruku will save the output as a comma-separated value file called `ace_all.csv`. This can be opened in Excel or whatever program you like to use, if you want. If you load it back into R with `read.csv`, it looks like this:
```
    X         name      time NA.        value       climvar
1   1     bassleri  0.000000  NA 2.281429e+02    bio_1_mean

14 14        Node7  2.267554  NA 1.480499e+01   bio_1_stdev
...
```
(I've only printed the first 14 lines.) As you can see, the structure of the .csv is quite different than the `ace.all` object, which was a list where each element was a table with the values of each separate climate response parameter for each taxon. Here, it's been reformatted so that the `climvar` column takes the place of separating each parameter into its own element of a list. The issue is that, for this to actually be useful, we need to be able to load the output back into Machuruku. We can use the function `machu.ace.load()` here:
```
# load ace_all.csv
ace.all <- machu.ace.load("ace_all.csv")
```
If you look at `ace.all` here, you'll see it's identical to the original and formatted correctly as a list.
### Projecting ancestral models into paleoclimatic data
The final major step in Machuruku is to use `machu.3.anc.niche()` to project the ancestral niche models estimated and parsed by `machu.2.ace()` into paleoclimate data. This step loops through each taxon in the `machu.2.ace()` output and constructs a Bioclim model in the provided paleoclimate data. Here I'm projecting our `ace.M2` models, consisting of two taxa interpolated to 3.3 Ma, into the M2 climate data:
```
mod <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.M2, ClimM2, verbose = T)
```
This step is the most time-consuming part of Machuruku, though it shouldn't take too long in this instance since we only have two taxa and two climate variables. As you add taxa and climate variables, it'll begin to take longer.

If we look at `mod`, we see that it is a list where each element is a Raster layer corresponding to a niche model for each taxon:
```
$`Node5-Node6`
class      : RasterLayer 
dimensions : 328, 253, 82984  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
resolution : 0.04166667, 0.04166667  (x, y)
extent     : -81.49866, -70.95699, -14.0478, -0.3811359  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
crs        : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs 
source     : memory
names      : layer 
values     : 0, 0.9999929  (min, max)

$`Node5-silverstonei`
class      : RasterLayer 
dimensions : 328, 253, 82984  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
resolution : 0.04166667, 0.04166667  (x, y)
extent     : -81.49866, -70.95699, -14.0478, -0.3811359  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
crs        : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs 
source     : memory
names      : layer 
values     : 0, 0.9939741  (min, max)
```
We can use the accessory function `machu.plotmap()` to actually show what these models look like, which is the whole point of this process anyway:
```
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
machu.plotmap(mod)
```
![2 models w rarefied occ data](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/2%20mods%20rare.png?raw=true)

Note that these are nearly identical to the models I constructed in the Quick-start Guide above; the only differences are due to the fact that I used spatially rarefied occurrence data here, whereas in the Quick-start Guide I did not.
> You can specify different color ramps using the `col` argument in this function and specifying a number (1:6). 1 = base, 2 = plasma, 3 = viridis, 4 = l17, 5 = r3, 6 = white-to-black. Default = 1.

In the case where we ran `machu.2.ace()` without specifying a time-slice, getting `ace.all`, we can project both the extant taxa and the three nodes into the same climate layers to see how they directly compare in identical climate space:
```
# build present-day models for all taxa including ancestors
mod.all <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.all, ClimCur, verbose = T)
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
machu.plotmap(mod.all)
plot(bassleritree)
```
![7 models in current climate w/ tree](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/7%20mod.png?raw=true)

I've used a plot of the tree to fill up the eighth panel. Remember, this is all in modern climate, so the three nodal taxa would not necessarily have lived in these areas, but perhaps they would today if they were still extant. (Of course, these are terrible models since we're only using two climate variables in this tutorial; the only even somewhat accurate one is the one for *A. silverstonei*, though of course the ancestral models are speculative). 

If you're only interested in a few taxa at a time, you can use the `taxa` argument to specify which ones:
```
# build present-day models for only extant taxa
mod.extant <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.all, ClimCur, verbose = T, taxa = 1:4)
par(mfrow=c(1,4))
machu.plotmap(mod.extant)
```

#### Clipping response curve tails to produce cleaner models
The `machu.3.anc.niche()` function includes a variety of additional arguments that allow you to further explore your models. One is the `clip.Q` argument, which "trims" or "clips" the tails of the response curves by setting the portions beyond the reconstructed `lowerQ` and `upperQ` parameters equal to zero. By default, the `clip.Q` argument is actually turned on, because it tends to produce cleaner models. However, to fully characterize the tails of these distributions, we can turn `clip.Q` off:
```
# turn clip.Q off
mod.clip.Q <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.M2, ClimM2, verbose = T, clip.Q = F)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
machu.plotmap(mod)
machu.plotmap(mod.clip.Q)
```
![4 models clip Q off bottom](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/4%20mod%20clipQ.png?raw=true)

The top two models are from the `mod` object we previously made, where `clip.Q = TRUE`. The bottom two models are from `mod.clip.Q`, where `clip.Q = FALSE`. You'll notice that it captures quite a bit more area, albeit of lower suitability.
#### Creating binary models
Another option is the `resp.curv` argument, which tells Machuruku that you want to use response curve information to characterize the niche. If you set this argument to FALSE, Machuruku instead sets all values outside of the bounds defined by `lowerQ` and `upperQ` for each climate response curve equal to 0, and all values inside of them to 1 - effectively creating a uniform distribution defined by `lowerQ` and `upperQ`. This is closer in nature to the original way Bioclim worked. In cases where you want a binary suitability surface, it may be useful.
```
# use resp.curv = F
mod.resp.curv <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.M2, ClimM2, verbose = T, resp.curv = F)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
machu.plotmap(mod)
machu.plotmap(mod.resp.curv)
```
![4 models resp curv on](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/4%20mod%20respcurv.png?raw=true)

Once again, the top two models are from `mod`, with `resp.curv = TRUE` (default). The bottom two models are with `resp.curv = FALSE`. As you can see, they capture a similar area, but all of it has the same (maximum) suitability. This is more like saying the taxon is equally likely to inhabit any of these pixels.
> Note that `resp.curv` and `clip.Q` can never be turned on at the same time because they're redundant; `resp.curv` already clips the tails since it uses `upperQ` and `lowerQ` as the bounds for the uniform distribution. `clip.Q` simply does not set the intervening values equal to one like `resp.curv`.

#### Incorporating uncertainty from ancestral character estimation
You might remember the `n.unc` argument from `machu.2.ace()`, that we used to sample the distribution of possible ancestral character estimation values for each climate response parameter, and then sort them into additional niche models. Here is where we incorporate that information. Setting `n.unc` to TRUE (it's FALSE by default) will essentially construct separate models for all of the samples you took (so, five in our case), then sum them, and rescale them so that the maximum value is still 1. 
```
# use calc.unc = T
mod.calc.unc <- machu.3.anc.niche(ace.M2.unc, ClimM2, verbose = T, calc.unc = T)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
machu.plotmap(mod)
machu.plotmap(mod.calc.unc)
```
![4 models calc unc on](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/4%20mod%20calcunc.png?raw=true)

Again, the top two models are from `mod`, with `calc.unc = FALSE`, and the bottom two models are from `mod.calc.unc`, with `calc.unc = TRUE` (also notice that we used `ace.M2.unc` as our input, not `ace.M2`). The models incorporating uncertainty are actually a bit narrower in terms of the highly suitable habitat, but should characterize the total variability in suitability better than the other models.

#### Limiting model area with inverse-distance weighting
Often, niche models will recover areas obviously outside the known range of a species as suitable. While this can be useful, depending on the question it may be superfluous or misleading. To that end, we added a function called `machu.geo.idw` that uses inverse-distance weighting to restrict niche models to the areas surrounding the taxon's distribution. Essentially, this is a way for accounting for migration limitations by removing from consideration suitable areas that are nonetheless separated from the taxon's actual distribution by geographic barriers or other factors. An obvious hurdle for this function is that *we don't know* what the actual distributions of ancestral taxa were; figuring that out is the whole point of Machuruku in the first place. To (sort of) get around this, the user just specifies an extant taxon distribution (as occurrence data) to represent the ancestral taxon. This is obviously an imperfect system, but it's the best that can be done absent voluminous fossil data. The function is used as such:
```
clip <- machu.geo.idw(mod[[2]], occ, taxa = "silverstonei", buffer.dist = 100, kernel.size = 2, MCP.percent = 50)
```
> Note that here we're using `occ` rather than `occ.rarefied` because the latter only contains 3 occurrence points for *A. silverstonei* and the function needs at least 5 to work.

In its current implementation, only one taxon can be run through `machu.geo.idw` at once. This is because the user will likely want to specify different occurrence data and buffer distances, etc., for each taxon. In this example, we are using `mod[[2]]` as our taxon to clip, which represents the ancestral taxon "node5-silverstonei" projected into M2 climate data. We specify our `occ.rarefied` occurrence data, and further specify *A. silverstonei* as the extant taxon whose data we wish to use. 
> If you want to specify a *combination* of extant taxa to use, you can do that too. For instance, if you're clipping `mod[[1]]`, the "node5-node6" taxon (ancestor to the *bassleri* group, you can specify `taxa=c("pepperi","bassleri","yoshina")` to include the entire distribution of the *bassleri* group as a proxy for the distribution of its MRCA. 

What this function does is basically construct a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the input points, whose size is determined by the `buffer.dist` parameter, which is by default set to 300 kilometers. It then creates a second buffer around the MCP that smooths the model's probability from 1 (adjacent to the MCP) to 0 at the edge of this second buffer. The second smooth buffer's size is determined by the `kernel.size` parameter (default = 1), which is multiplied against the `buffer.dist` parameter to calculate the size; i.e., if `buffer.dist = 100` and `kernel.size = 2`, the second buffer will be 200 km wide. The `mcp.percent` (default = 100) determines the percentage of outlier occurrence points to be removed before construction of the original MCP. 

To visualize what `machu.geo.idw` does, do the following:
```
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(mod[[2]])
plot(clip)
```
![normal model vs. linear-distance weighted model](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/blob/main/tutorial/images/idw.png?raw=true)

As you can see, the clipped model (right) is now restricted to the area surrounding the extant *A. silverstonei* distribution. The left model is the original node5-silverstonei model in M2 climate.
